# re-frame-template

Leiningen template for [reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent) web apps which implement the [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) pattern.

Through the use of profiles, this template lets the developer pick and choose what "extras" are included in their application.

## Basic Usage

The base template includes:

* [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame)
* [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel)
* [cljs-devtools](https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools)

To create an application with the base template:

```
lein new re-frame <project-name>
```

> **Troubleshooting note:** for `<project-name>` don't use `cljs`. That name will confuse the compiler and you will (later) see errors like `cljs.core.init is not a function`

## Extras

The optional profiles include:

* CSS
  * [garden](https://github.com/noprompt/garden) (`+garden`)
  * [less](https://github.com/montoux/lein-less) (`+less`)
* Debug
  * [re-frame-10x](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-10x) (`+10x`)
  * [re-frisk](https://github.com/flexsurfer/re-frisk) (`+re-frisk`)
  * [dirac](https://github.com/binaryage/dirac) (`+dirac`)
* Development
  * [cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider) (`+cider`)
  * [cljs.test](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/blob/master/src/main/cljs/cljs/test.cljs) and [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) (`+test`)
* Full-stack
  * [compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure) (`+handler`)
* Misc.
  * [re-com](https://github.com/Day8/re-com) (`+re-com`)
  * [re-pressed](https://github.com/gadfly361/re-pressed) (`+re-pressed`)
  * [breaking-point](https://github.com/gadfly361/breaking-point) (`+breaking-point`)
* Routing
  * [secretary](https://github.com/gf3/secretary) (`+routes`)

To add a profile to the base template, just append the profile name (let's use `+re-com` as an example):

```
lein new re-frame <project-name> +re-com
```

Any combination of profiles can be added at once:

```
lein new re-frame <project-name> +garden +re-com +routes +test +less +10x
```

>  Note: to assist debugging, you'll want to include either `+10x` or `+re-frisk` 


## Start Cider from Emacs (if using +cider):

Put this in your Emacs config file:

```
(setq cider-cljs-lein-repl
	"(do (require 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/start-figwheel!)
         (figwheel-sidecar.repl-api/cljs-repl))")
```

Navigate to a clojurescript file and start a figwheel REPL with `cider-jack-in-clojurescript` or (`C-c M-J`)


## Compile css (if using +garden or +less):

Compile css file once.

```
lein garden once

lein less once
```


Automatically recompile css file on change.

```
lein garden auto

lein less auto
```

## Run application:

Retrieve dependencies:
```
lein deps
```

Then run:
```
lein clean
lein figwheel dev
```

Wait a bit, then browse to [http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449).

## Setting Up Your Browser

So, you now have the application running.

Before you start developing, you should tweak two settings within your 
browser's `devtools`. These are one-time actions (for each browser and laptop you use). 
I'll assume Chrome for the purposes of further explanation: 

1. Open devtools. Press press `F12` or `Ctrl-Shift-i` ([actually there's a variety of ways](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools))
1. Open devtool's "Setting" Panel. Press F1. (Careful. Not the Setting panel for Chrome itself!! The Settings panel for devtools)
1. Under the "Network" heading, tick the option "Disable cache (while DevTools is open)". You don't want figwheel's attempts at reloading to be defeated by caching. 
1. Under the "Console" heading, tick the option "Enable custom formatters". This allows [cljs-devtools](https://github.com/binaryage/cljs-devtools) to perform its magic.
1. Close Settings. Close Devtools. 
1. Reopen Devtools

## Open 10x Panel (if using +10x):

To use `re-frame-10x` for debugging your app: 
  1. click on the application, minimal through it is, to give it "input<project-name> focus" (you want to be sure that any key presses are going to your new app)
  2. press `Ctrl-H` and you should see the `re-frame-10x` panel appear on the right side of the window

Sometimes achieving Step 1 on a really simple app - one without widgets - can be fiddly, 
because the browser itself hogs "input focus" and grabs all the keystrokes (like `Ctrl-H`) which don't
then make it through to your app. You may need to be determined and creative with Step 1. 
I have every confidence in you.

## Hot Reloading Is Now Go

If you now edit files, like perhaps `/src/cljs/<project-name>/views.cljs`, Figwheel will automatically 
recompile your changes and "hot load" them into your running app, without your app needing 
to be re-started. The resulting fast, iterative workflow tends to make you very productive, and 
is cherished by those lucky enough to experience it.

### debug?:

In _project-name.config_, there is a variable called `debug?`, which
defaults to _true_. However, for the `min` build (look inside of `project.clj`), this variable is
re-defined to _false_.

When `debug?` is true, we include `(enable-console-print!)`. If you, for example, 
you wrap your `println`s with a `when` block as show below, then you will get logs 
printed to the browser's console for the `dev` build and not the `min` build.

```clojure
(when config/debug?
  (println "dev mode"))
```

## Run tests (if using +test):

Install karma and headless chrome

```
npm install -g karma-cli
npm install karma karma-cljs-test karma-chrome-launcher --save-dev
```

And then run your tests

```
lein clean
lein doo chrome-headless test once
```

Please note that [doo](https://github.com/bensu/doo) can be configured to run cljs.test in many JS environments (phantom, chrome, ie, safari, opera, slimer, node, rhino, or nashorn).

## Production Build

To compile clojurescript to javascript:

```
lein clean
lein cljsbuild once min
```

### Deploy to heroku (if using `+handler`)

Create uberjar

```
lein clean
lein with-profile prod uberjar
```

Create app on heroku

```
heroku create
```

Then deploy the application

```
git push heroku master
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed!  To add a new profile, this is what I'd recommend:

1. Add a file with the name of the profile [here](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/tree/master/src/leiningen/new/options)
2. Look at the existing options in that folder for inspiration for what to include in that file
3. Update [project.clj](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/blob/master/src/leiningen/new/re_frame.clj) with the profile
4. Add any new files [here](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/tree/master/src/leiningen/new/re_frame) and use the {{ var-name }} syntax as needed
5. Update the [README](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/tree/master/src/leiningen/new/re_frame) that will result when the template is used, as well as the top-level [README](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/blob/master/README.md) for re-frame-template itself
6. In a terminal, at the root of re-frame-template, run `lein install`
7. Locally test that your profile works, `lein new re-frame <app-name> +<profile-name>`
8. Add your profile to [create-templates](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame-template/blob/master/create-templates.sh) and run the script to make sure the other profiles didn't break.
